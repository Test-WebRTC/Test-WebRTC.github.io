# WebRTC code samples

This is a repository for the WebRTC JavaScript code samples. All of the samples can be tested from [webrtc.github.io/samples](https://webrtc.github.io/samples).

We welcome contributions and bugfixes. Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/webrtc/samples/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.

## Testing

Some of the samples have an associated test. These are currently using [Nightwatch.JS](https://nightwatchjs.org) and
are only testing the UI of the samples. The purpose of these is to provide examples of how you can write UI tests for
your WebRTC web application.
